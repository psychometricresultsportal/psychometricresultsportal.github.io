/NOTE: This site is to be used for data collection in a study by the University of Adelaide (Australia). 
Participants enter a password (the username is prefilled for them), but this does not leave the client machine. Instead, the strength of the password chosen is analysed client-side. ONLY the strength of the password (and some basic data, such as whether a special character was used) is sent to our survey platform (Qualtrics). 
You can see the specifics of this in the getPassword() function in index.html.
Details of how the password is analysed client-side are available here: https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn
Please contact the researcher at a1629120@adelaide.edu.au for any issues. 
This study has received ethics approval from the University of Adelaide HREC. This message will be removed before data collection begins
